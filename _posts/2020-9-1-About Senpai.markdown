# Welcome!
&nbsp;
My name is Devansh, and I'm a 17 year old student. I've studied Japanese for 5 years, and have passed JLPT N5 (score: 111) and JLPT N4 (score: N5). Over the net, there are various sites that provide you with some kind of reference material, but either they are paid or the sites are full of ads.
So, I thought that I should make an open-source site, for JLPT aspiring students to provide them with the best study materials and references out there on the internet. I've compiled most of the pdf files, and will also add my hand-written notes soon :)
&nbsp;
Also, having some experience of how to prepare for such tests, I've added links to the websites and apps that I used for my preparation, and will also add some tips for the same. N5 is an easy exam, and with right preparation you can ace it. The most difficult part according to me is grammar and listening, so you should focus on them more. I'm still finding resources for listening and grammar and will keep updating them.
